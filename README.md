Sound Hackers Application ‘Scalar’ v.0.0.1 by Evgeniy Vashchenko (V4W.ENKO)  

We’re honoured to release the second application of the Coded Matter(s) series, connected to our second edition called Sound Hackers. This application is an interactive sound environment created by Ukrainian sound artist Evgeniy Vashchenko aka V4W.ENKO. It reacts to your movement using your computer’s webcam. Slow and fast movements trigger different interactions with a surrounding sound and 3D sculpture, through which you slowly float.  

To run the application you need two things: a webcam and an installed version of Max Runtime on your Mac or PC (for PC please use the x86 runtime version only). Max Runtime is a free piece of software which acts as a player for the visual programming language called Max. Even if you don’t own Max, you can run existing Max patches without editing capabilities. If your computer is not equipped with standard Java Runtime and Quick Time, please also install these components. 

1. Download the zip 
2. Open the file “__start-me” from the folder 
3. Interact with your webcam, explore and play
